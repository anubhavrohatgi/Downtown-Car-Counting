This 60 second h264-encoded file (king_st.avi) must be re-encoded to RAW format for OpenCV 
to process.

This creates a very large file, so it has not been uploaded here.

- Download ffmpeg (http://ffmpeg.org/)
- CMD: $ ffmpeg -i king_st.avi -vcodec rawvideo king_st_raw.avi

The paths to the raw video file and jpg mask are command-line parameters for the car
counting software.
